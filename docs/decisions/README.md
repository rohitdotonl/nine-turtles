# Decisions

Short notes on significant technical decisions: what was decided, why, and
what would make us revisit it. They exist so a future agent (or person)
doesn't undo a deliberate choice by accident.

One file per decision, numbered in order: `NNNN-short-name.md`. A note is
never deleted; if a decision changes, a new note replaces it and the old one
says "Replaced by …" at the top.

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| [0001](0001-one-check-script.md) | Every check runs through one script |
| [0002](0002-pinned-tool-versions.md) | Exact versions of Rust, Node and GitHub's building blocks |
| [0003](0003-library-check.md) | How the library check knows what's approved |
| [0004](0004-search-hindi.md) | Search splits words so Hindi stays whole |
| [0005](0005-screenshots.md) | Screenshots appear as a comment on each pull request |
| [0006](0006-second-agent-review.md) | The second-agent review is written instructions, not an app |
| [0007](0007-repository-layout.md) | `server/` and `web/`, with the frontend packed into the program |
| [0008](0008-fonts-and-placeholder-colors.md) | Fonts served in pieces; placeholder colors until Milestone 4 |
| [0009](0009-agents-may-merge.md) | Agents may merge after a brief and the owner's yes |
| [0010](0010-sign-in.md) | How sign-in works: setting the password, signed-in devices, wrong guesses |
| [0011](0011-container-image.md) | The container image, where it's stored, and automatic deploys |
| [0012](0012-v1-for-one-reader.md) | V1 is for one reader: no backups, and six features moved to V2 |
| [0013](0013-look-and-feel.md) | Look and feel: colors, fonts, type scale, reader settings per device, addresses |
| [0014](0014-no-plan-step.md) | No separate plan to approve: agents build from PLAN and SPEC, asking only when needed |
| [0015](0015-saving-tokens.md) | Spending fewer tokens: one milestone per thread, light reviews, shorter AGENTS.md and DESIGN.md |
| [0016](0016-adding-feeds.md) | Adding feeds: autodiscovery on the pasted page, private addresses refused, cleaning before storing, list order and speed test |
| [0017](0017-reading-articles.md) | Reading articles: tracking images removed by size, images from anywhere, prefetching, selecting is showing |
