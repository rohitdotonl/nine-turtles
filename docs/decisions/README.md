# Decisions

Short notes on significant technical decisions: what was decided, why, and
what would make us revisit it. They exist so a future agent (or person)
doesn't undo a deliberate choice by accident.

One file per decision, numbered in order: `NNNN-short-name.md`. A note is
never deleted; if a decision changes, a new note replaces it and the old one
says "Replaced by …" at the top.

| [0002](0002-pinned-tool-versions.md) | Exact versions of Rust, Node and GitHub's building blocks |
| [0003](0003-library-check.md) | How the library check knows what's approved |
| [0004](0004-search-hindi.md) | Search splits words so Hindi stays whole |
| [0005](0005-screenshots.md) | Screenshots appear as a comment on each pull request |
| [0006](0006-second-agent-review.md) | The second-agent review is written instructions, not an app |
| [0007](0007-repository-layout.md) | `server/` and `web/`, with the frontend packed into the program |
| [0008](0008-fonts-and-placeholder-colors.md) | Fonts served in pieces; placeholder colors until Milestone 4 |
